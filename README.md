Rails from PHP
==============

There are a lot of developers who would make the switch from PHP to rails but find the transition not as seamless as they want.
The goal of the course to make a practical , seamless transition from PHP to ruby .

The course draws comparisons from both languages and attempts to to teach you how to do the same things you do with PHP with ruby .

This objective is not to start a language war but rather to empower developers to have more tools in their toolbox. Each language has it's
own strengths .
